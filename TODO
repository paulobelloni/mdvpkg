* mdvpkg TODO list

** TODO Examine if dbus methods could return data instead of return signals

** TODO Fix download errors responses

** TODO _set_latest_installed should set the version type directly
   Calling _set_latest_installed should set the version to
   'installed'.

** TODO Make _list_by_type receive more then one type
   To easy the selection of upgrades and downgrades.

** TODO Pass package object withing package-changed signal from urpmi
   Use that to update filters and emit list signals.

** TODO Set a cleaner way to adjust in_progress status after PA
   Without accessing package.in_progress directly, it is also needed
   to fix the assert to the progress callbacks.

** TODO Optimize create_pkg_map
   Put fullnames in a list and populate by removing from the list,
   stopping as soon as there are no more names, avoiding to iterate
   over all depslist.  Also visit db only if necessary (after
   depslist).

** TODO Implement interface to perform updates

** TODO Respond correctly to changes in rpm/urpm db
   Find a way to monitor rpmdb; use the callbacks in Package class for
   rpmdb changes.

   Use inotify to monitor urpmdb (synthesis) and reload package cache,
   emitting relevant signals so PackageList can update itself.
